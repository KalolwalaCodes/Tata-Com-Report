                            Our dedicated endeavours have enabled lasting changes within society, empowered people, created sustainable livelihood sources
                            and unlocked opportunities for underserved sections of society. Guided by our CSR Vision of ‘Creating connected societies
                            to advance the well-being of
                            people and planet,’ we aspire to continuously impact communities by differentiating ourselves as a unique ecosystem of connections.
                            <br /><br />
                            We contribute to Sustainable Development through our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) projects focused on creating a positive impact on the economy, society,
                            and the environment. Our CSR framework is built on the foundation of integrity and good corporate governance. We believe that technology plays a significant role
                            in accelerating human development and resolving global challenges.
                            Our CSR vision is aligned with
                            the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We approach social and environmental challenges to create value for all our customers, employees, shareholders, and communities for long-term success. While working towards the benefit of the community at large, we respect the culture, customs
                            and traditions of each country and region where we operate. Our CSR programmes derive inspiration from Tata Group’s philosophy ‘to improve the quality of life of the communities we serve globally through long term stakeholder value creation based on leadership with trust’.

It reflects our intent to reach underserved communities in locations which are in dire need of social interventions, (due to historical, geographical isolation) with low values on Human Development indicators (such as in ‘Aspirational Districts’ identified by the Government of India Apart from India.

                            and hence, we establish multi- year partnerships with NGOs ensuring there is adequate time to create impact.

                            We follow a life cycle approach to partnership and have adopted a multi-layered evaluation process for partner selection. After conducting thorough due diligence, we select regional and/or national partners. Our CSR projects also undergo through extensive monitoring
                            and evaluation by our leadership and Board Committees, using a structured framework.

                            to participate in an emerging technology regulatory Sandbox in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia where we showcased our connected car capabilities and partnered with the regulator to open up the market
                            to more advanced technologies.
                            We have also filed comments in
                            a U.S. Federal Communications Commission proceeding and U.S. FCC proceeding. We leverage our memberships in global organizations to represent our position on
                            issues impacting business and
                            new areas like Captive Private Networks and M2M Services.

                            We engage with various Indian industry associations to protect business interests amidst regulatory changes and industry developments. India’s highly regulated telecom market requires stringent compliance. We align our business with licensing and regulatory compliance requirements through an internal online compliance monitoring mechanism. This system ensures timely submissions of compliance reports to regulators, licensors, and other statutory authorities.
