            The Tata Code of Conduct (‘TCOC’) is the foundation that governs the
            behaviour and operations of Tata Communications. The TCOC embodies a
            set of core values and principles that are crucial to the way we
            conduct our business. It serves as a comprehensive guide for our
            employees, as well as our partners, customers, suppliers, and third
            parties, ensuring that everyone associated with the Company adheres
            to the highest standards of ethical conduct.
            <br />
            The TCOC sets out the guidelines and creates a living framework that
            influences our daily operations and strategic decisions. The core
            values and principles enshrined in the TCOC translate into codified
            policies and practical procedures within the organisation to ensure
            shared commitment to the core values. It guides our business
            practices to be transparent, accountable and aligned with our
            dedication to the highest ethical standards. This includes
            maintaining integrity, respecting human rights, and fostering an
            inclusive and dignified workplace.

            E-Learning and Certification

            We have implemented a mandatory web- based e-learning module on the
            TCOC for all employees, which requires annual re-certification. This
            training is also part of the onboarding process for new employees,
            who are inducted into the Company. The module includes an assessment
            to test employees’ understanding of the TCOC, culminating in a
            certification that enables them to uphold the desired standards.

            Beyond the e-learning modules, the Legal Compliance team conducts
            extensive company-wide live training sessions. These sessions
            encompass various policies which derive their essence from the TCOC
            and ensure that all employees, fully understand and can practically
            apply these policies in their routine work.

            In FY24, a company- wide ‘Living the Code’ initiative was propagated

            about how they have embraced and implemented the Tata Code of
            Conduct in their lives. This initiative focussed on celebrating our
