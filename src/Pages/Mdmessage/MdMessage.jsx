        <span className="dark-blue-head font-bold">Dear Shareholders, <br /></span> In my last letter to you I shared our commitment to
        achieving strong and sustainable growth. It gives me immense pleasure to
        say that we have taken another firm step forward in that journey during
        FY24. This year was a landmark year for us, with our overall revenues
        surpassing the ₹ 20,000-crore milestone and data revenues crossing ₹
        17,000 crores. I see this as an outcome of a solid execution on a sound
        strategy. This remarkable accomplishment is a testament to our strategic
        focus on enhancing digital platforms and solutions, globally.

        At Tata Communications, we are undergoing a transformation of profound
        scale and scope. <br />
        Continued investments in our core network infrastructure (network
        fabric) have enabled us to develop multifaceted software-defined
        capabilities while also maintaining our position as a major global
        player in voice communications. Our customer interaction fabric, focused
        on streamlining B2C customer interaction across all channels through our
        platforms is another key growth driver for us.
        <br />A strong performance in India’s private cloud market, coupled with
        our robust security portfolio, has created a strong foundation for
        international expansion in Cloud Security and Edge (cloud fabric). Our
        IoT fabric, a smaller portfolio currently, presents significant growth
        opportunities both domestically and internationally. Each of these
        fabrics holds substantial ‘white space’ for future expansion.

      <p className="normal-text-container mt-4">
        Several strategic decisions made during the year have shaped our growth
        trajectory. This fiscal, we completed the acquisition of Kaleyra. In the
        digital age, businesses require multi-channel customer engagement
        solutions built for intuitive, intelligent, and automated interactions.
        Combining our customer engagement solutions with Kaleyra’s stronghold in
        technological expertise will drive the growth of global enterprises
        through hyper-personalised and intelligent customer interactions. We
        also completed the acquisition of The Switch Enterprises LLC (The
        Switch), which has helped us expand our reach to top tier US sporting
        event venues and gain a strong foothold in North America and has
        amplified our media and entertainment portfolio in end- to-end video
        production and transmission capabilities. This will revolutionise live
        video experiences for viewers and fans across various platforms.
        Acquisition of the remaining 41.9% equity in Oasis Smart SIM Europe, to
        make us the sole shareholder has helped us leverage the combined power
        of Tata Communications MOVETM platform and Oasis eSIM (embedded SIM) and
        remote SIM provisioning capabilities to equip global enterprises with
        end-to-end, scalable and secure eSIM connectivity, a cornerstone for
        delivering intelligent and intuitive IoT applications, and stitching a
        digital fabric of secure, connected experiences. Collaboration is at the
        heart of our success. Our partnership with Microsoft exemplifies this
        commitment. By leveraging our Tata Communications GlobalRapide platform
        and Microsoft’s Operator Connect, we’re enabling businesses of all sizes
        and locations in India to experience seamless voice calling on Teams
        devices. Given our extensive reach across 190+ countries and

      <p className="normal-text-container mt-4">
        Sustainability remains a core of our business strategy and we are
        committed to be Net Zero by 2035 across our global operations. We
        minimise our environmental footprint, integrate renewable energy, and
        empower our customers on their sustainability journeys. In line with our
        sustainability efforts, a key milestone this year was the adoption of a
        sustainability-linked loan (SLL) framework, a first in our sector for
        India. This innovative financing approach ties loan margins to our
        carbon emission reduction targets, demonstrating our dedication to
        responsible business practices and long-term sustainability leadership.
        By incorporating renewable energy sources in our energy consumption mix,
        we are reaffirming our commitment to environmental responsibility and
        adopting eco- friendly energy alternatives. Furthermore, our Science
        Based Targets initiative (‘SBTi’) - approved targets mark a
        transformative shift, aligning technological advancement with
        environmental stewardship. By embracing the SBTi’s target-setting
